## 📊 KEY CONCEPTS

### The Four Roles
```
HSE001 - Lié Orphé BOURDES
├─ Level: Executive (5)
├─ Role: Chief of HSSE and Compliance Division
├─ Reports to: Executive Board
└─ Manages: Both HSE002 and CONF001 branches

HSE002 - Lise Véronique DITSOUGOU
├─ Level: Operations Manager (4)
├─ Role: Chief of Operational HSSE
├─ Reports to: HSE001
├─ Manages: REC001 (Sylvie)
└─ Focus: Daily ops, incidents, training

CONF001 - Pierrette NOMSI
├─ Level: Compliance Manager (4)

```

### The Three Key Workflows
```
1. Incident Management
   Report → HSE002 Assess → Approve/Escalate → CONF001 Audit → Close

2. Compliance Verification
   NOMSI Audit → Findings → HSE002 Actions → NOMSI Verifies → Close

3. Training Validation
   HSE002 Delivers → Records → NOMSI Validates → Reports → Close
```

### The Segregation of Duties
```
✅ HSE002 DOES: Approves incidents, manages operations, coordinates training
❌ HSE002 CANNOT: Modify approved incidents, access compliance reports, override audits

✅ CONF001 DOES: Conducts audits, verifies compliance, validates training
❌ CONF001 CANNOT: Approve incidents, make operational decisions, manage personnel

✅ REC001 DOES: Reports security incidents, manages visitors, controls access
❌ REC001 CANNOT: Approve incidents, access compliance data, escalate

✅ HSE001 DOES: Everything (executive oversight)
❌ HSE001 SHOULD NOT: Get involved in routine decisions (delegation)
